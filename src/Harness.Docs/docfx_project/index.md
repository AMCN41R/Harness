# **HARNESS**.
Harness is a free and open source .NET library designed to manage the state of a Mongo database during testing.

At its core, it endeavours to aid unit and integration testing by putting one or more Mongo databases in a known state at the beginning of a test, or suite of tests. The framework allows you to control your codeâ€™s dependency on a Mongo database, therefore increasing test consistency and repeat-ability.
